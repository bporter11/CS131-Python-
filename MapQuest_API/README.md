This project uses the mapquest web API to get directions to specific locations and also uses the Mapquest Elevation API to grab essential information. Once the program appends the user inputted locations into the mapquest api Url it then turns that information from JSON text into humanly readible txt that python can use. This program then gets information for desired amount of stops, and how many peices of information the user wants assuming the user knows the correct input format.
